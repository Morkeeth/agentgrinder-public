"""The public product name and tagline come from one file and reach the built site.

Ruling 2026-09-16 09:22: the public product is STRIVE, tagline "Post your strides".
The source tree carries the __BRAND__ and __TAGLINE__ tokens; scripts/build-site.mjs
replaces them from server/brand.mjs. These checks go red if the token stops being
replaced, if a second brand literal appears in the plumbing, or if the old name
returns to a stranger-visible string.
