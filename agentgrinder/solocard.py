"""THE GRIND CARD — one ordinary session, made postable.

Runs are the product noun; grind remains the compatible CLI command. The trace is the signature visual across local cards and the network.

THE NUMBER AT THE TOP IS VERIFIED PER TURN, never the prompt count. Prompts are the cost of a
grind (the denominator); a card whose first big number is "47 prompts" crowns the person who
typed the most (METR 2025: developers believed +20%, measured -19%). The Strava-shaped numbers --
prompts, moving time, commits -- are all still here, grouped under COST. Where the run has
no verified-claims count (an old `--json` dump), the headline is an em-dash whose tooltip names
what is missing, not a zero. `metrics.headline_of` is the one definition every surface reads.

Every sentence here names what it counted and over which population, or prints an em-dash.

    Rung 1 is the fact the fleet card puts at the top of a night run, measured the same way at
    one-session scale: the longest span nobody typed through. It is only allowed to be the
    headline when the agent was demonstrably working through it -- 8 minutes of ACTIVE time and
    at least 12 tool calls -- because "you left the room for an hour" is a gap, not a stretch,
    and a card that crowned it would be inflating in the flattering direction.

    The GATE is `active_s` (the agent's moving time). The NUMBER printed is `wall_s`, because the
    noun is "minutes without touching the keyboard" and that is a fact about the person, not about
    the agent's moving time. Printing `active_s` under that noun was a correct count of the wrong
    thing: the callout right below it prints both boundary timestamps, so on `grind-deep` the card
    said "52 minutes" over "14:40 ... 15:37", which is 57. Two correct numbers, adjacent, asserting
    a relation that does not hold -- caught 31 Aug by subtracting the two stamps the card itself
    prints. The trace band label is the same number, from the same field, for the same reason.

    And the number is computed from the two stamps AS PRINTED (`span_minutes` floors both to the
    minute, exactly as `%H:%M` does), not from raw seconds: rounding raw `wall_s` put "14 minutes"
    over "16:29 ... 16:44" on `grind-ordinary`, a one-minute version of the same defect. The rule
    is that the reader's own subtraction is the definition.
