"""THE PRIVACY RULE — what a card may print, and the control that fails the build when it doesn't.

Why this file exists
--------------------
A grind card is built out of one person's local machine. Every row label started life as an
absolute path on that machine, every headline started life as a sentence they typed. The old
renderer's only path treatment was `_shorten`, and `_shorten` was written for READABILITY, not for
privacy — it swapped `$HOME` for `~` and, when a path was still too long, kept THE LAST TWO
SEGMENTS. That is exactly backwards: it drops the harmless prefix and keeps the identifying tail.
Shipped cards printed, as row labels: two files from the agent's own memory directory, a note
from a synced-notes vault, an absolute path under the author's home, and — inside a repo whose
relative filenames are themselves the secret — four filenames naming two companies the author
was applying to.

The specific strings are deliberately NOT quoted here. An earlier draft of this docstring listed
them, which made this file, the one file whose whole job is to stop private names being printed,
the place where four of them were written down in tracked source. The evidence lives in
PRIVACY-2026-08-31.md with its commit shas; a rule does not need to repeat the secret to state
the rule.

The rule is POSITIVE, not a blocklist
-------------------------------------
`safe_label` decides what MAY appear. Anything it does not have a rule for degrades to a shape
word, never to a filename. A blocklist of bad strings fails the day a new bad string appears;
a positive rule fails closed.

    in the grind's own repo        ->  the path relative to the repo root        ("docs/PRD.md")
    in ANOTHER git repo            ->  that repo's NAME only, no file            ("morning-page")
    anywhere else on the machine   ->  a shape word, no basename                 ("elsewhere")
    a typed prompt                 ->  nothing, unless opt_in is passed

The in-repo case is the one real judgement call. A relative path inside the repo you are grinding
on is the content of the card — a card that cannot say `docs/PRD.md` has nothing to show. It is
still capable of leaking (see repo C above), which is why `safe_label` refuses a repo-relative
path that itself contains a home marker or a memory basename, and why the CARD-LEVEL control below
runs over the finished HTML regardless of which branch produced each label.

The control (`scan` / `assert_clean`)
-------------------------------------
Reads the rendered HTML — the artefact, not the source — and returns a finding for every home
path, synced-notes path, agent-config path, email address, or basename taken live from the memory
directory. It is the deliverable that outlives any one renderer fix: it does not know or care how
the label was produced.

Two deliberate properties:

* **The patterns are assembled at run time from fragments.** If they were written as literals this
  file would match itself, every scan of the repo's own source would be red, and the first thing
  anyone would do is add a carve-out for it. There are NO carve-outs. A control with an exception
  list is a control that will be taught to forgive the next real leak.
* **The memory basenames are read from disk at check time**, not baked in. A file added to the
  memory directory tomorrow is covered tonight without editing this file.

Run it:

    python3 -m agentgrinder privacycheck grind.html archive/hackathon-2026-09/docs/shots/six/*.html
